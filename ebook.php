<p class="entry-content" align="justify">
    Birds are getting more and more diffused as pets worldwide. Consequently, avian species are becoming increasingly popular as patients for veterinarians. Bird medicine is already a relevant branch of pet medicine. The emotional and economic value of avian pets is often important. Pet birds, parrots in particular, are often raised in farms, which have to count on adequate veterinarian support. The vet- erinarian community needs to get prepared to cope with all such needs. In most faculties, in fact, the courses of avian pathology are still more oriented toward the diagnosis, cure and prevention of poultry diseases than of avian pets. More recently, however, the growing interest in clinical personnel toward such species has led to the birth of specialized courses in companion avian medicine, and in speciﬁc texts in pet birds medicine. I am honoured to present this new text addressed to veteri- narians and students, which introduces very important scientiﬁc updates in avian medicine. The text is conveniently structured in sessions which treat all most rel- evant topics of avian medicine, and comprises a series of photographs to better illustrate all subjects. The approach is to present all useful practical information, relying on a thorough scientiﬁc treatment of all topics. The ﬁrst session concerns rearing and nutrition of pet birds. The following sessions are dedicated to the description of the most important infectious diseases, metabolic disorders and pathologies due to toxicity. These will provide the scientiﬁc and technical instru- ments which will carry the readers to the sessions treating with diagnostic tools and therapy. In the ﬁnal session, the potential zoonosis is discussed, including exhaustive guidelines for practitioners to prevent dangerous possible infections in human. This text will represent a reference book for veterinarians and interested in companion avian medicine.
